# BookLovers
Final Project- Online Book Store

The online book store application is designed to be a generic online ecommerce platform. Multiple vendors can register to use the platform to sell products online. Currently, each registered vendor will have their own unique online store URL for customers to access. A customer accessing a vendorâ€™s unique URL will be able to shop for product(s) that belongs to that particular vendor. 
 
The system has the flexibility to be enhanced with a common store front that consolidates all the vendors. With this enhancement, a customer can access the products of all registered vendors from a single point of entry.
